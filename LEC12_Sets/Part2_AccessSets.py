# WE Can't do set[0]
# Because it's not orderd and each time it will be random 
# but there is a way to print them all or check ( not we can't get index of item ) because it get changed each time

#Here where we print the set:
set1 = {"rakan","rayan","Owais"}
for x in set1:
    print(x)

# print something if an item was in one of the set items
if "rakan" in set1:
    print("WE found rakan in the set ")

# we can't change items or replace it. but we can add new items
