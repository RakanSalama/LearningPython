#A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
#example:
Dict = {"name":"Rakan",
        "age":22,
        "likes":"cats"}
print(Dict)
# it doesn't accept anything that is repeated ( it will overrite it)
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)
# print the length of the dir 
print(len(thisdict))

#data types
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}
print(thisdict)
